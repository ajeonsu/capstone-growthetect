# 🎴 RFID Student Selection Integration Guide

## ✅ **What's Done:**

1. ✅ Added `rfid_uid` column to database
2. ✅ Added RFID UID field to student registration form
3. ✅ Updated API to handle RFID UIDs

---

## 🚀 **What's Next:**

1. Create RFID reader API
2. Create Arduino RFID reader code
3. Integrate with BMI tracking page

---

## 📝 **Summary:**

Your RFID reader (visible in photos) will:
1. Read student RFID card
2. Send UID to website via Arduino bridge
3. Auto-select student in BMI tracking
4. Height auto-fills from ultrasonic
5. Weight manual entry (for now)
6. Quick, automatic workflow! 🎉

## 🔧 **Next Steps - I'll create the code now!**

Let me know when you're ready and I'll provide:
- Arduino code for RFID reader
- API endpoint for RFID lookup
- Integration with BMI tracking page

**Ready to continue?** 🚀
